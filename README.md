# RyPlanner
A website created for students of Ryerson University that helps pick your timetable with ease!


RyPlanner was released in January of 2016 and was used by over 1,500 users! It was also featured in The Ryersonian.

RyPlanner was developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is no longer in development as Ryerson University now has introduced an official Visual Schedule Builder through which students can enroll into courses.
